Dear ____,

Thank you again for being part of the Program Committee in the first edition of Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) in 2018! The workshop would not have been possible without your contribution https://nlposs.github.io/!

We have sent you an invite to the 2020 workshop previously but we haven't heard from you since our invitation. The 2nd edition of NLP-OSS workshop would be held in collocated with EMNLP 2020Â https://nlposs.github.io/2020/ on 11 or 12 November 2020. 

**Could we check with you whether you would like to continue to join us as a program committee (PC) member for the workshop in 2020?** Your experience with various NLP OSS is very valuable to the workshop that could be shared with the open source NLP communities.

We would be grateful if you could confirm your participation in the committee by replying to this email or post a comment on https://github.com/nlposs/NLP-OSS/issues/19. **If you have change your affiliations recently, please do reply to this email** and we'll make the changes accordingly for the NLP-OSS 2020 website.

As a committee member, you would help us to review paper and promote the workshop by encouraging submissions and circulating information. To avoid missing review deadlines and empty reviews, we would remove you from the PC list if there's not confirmation by 03 March 2020. In the event that you are unable to commit to the workshop PC, we understand that there are other commitments that you may be having but if you would like to keep in touch or be removed from our mailing list please do reply to this email to indicate your contact preferences. 

Please do give us any feedback about the workshop if you have any. Or any concerns about commitment as a PC member. 

Hope to hear from you soon!

Best Regards,
NLP-OSS Organizers
