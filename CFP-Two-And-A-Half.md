Workshop for NLP Opaque Source Software (NLP-O$$)

Deadline for Long and Short Paper submission: 09 September, 2050 (23:59, Anywhere on Earth/Mars)

With great scientific breakthrough comes solid engineering and money-backed ventures. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has benefited greatly from open source software and now it's time to fork those software, wrap them over with opaque cloud systems and added features to serve out APIs, creating an eco-system of a new generation of Generative AI businesses.

The primary objective of this workshop is to further the sharing of insights on monetizing NLP softwares and Large Language Models (LLM) in a manner that keeps a moat around your business. Our secondary goal is to promote and advertise the new NLP API services from small startups to big tech companies.

**Wait a Minute!! We don't want this to happen, not even in the future!**

Yes, dystopian as it sounds, it might a be reality if we stop discussing and promoting open source software in the NLP community. Take the opportunity to prevent NLP-O$$ from happening, share your knowledge/experience at the **3rd Workshop for NLP Open Source Software at EMNLP 2023**
