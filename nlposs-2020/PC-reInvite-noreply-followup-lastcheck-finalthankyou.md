Dear ____,

Thank you again for being part of the Program Committee in the first edition of Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) in 2018! The workshop would not have been possible without your contribution https://nlposs.github.io/!

We have sent you an invite to the 2020 workshop previously but we haven't heard from you since our invitation. The 2nd edition of NLP-OSS workshop would be held in collocated with EMNLP 2020Â https://nlposs.github.io/2020/ on 11 or 12 November 2020. 

We understand that you might have other committments and would not participate in the workshop as a PC member. 

To avoid missing review deadlines and empty reviews, **we would remove you from the PC list since we do not hear from you by 03 March 2020.** 

If you have missed our previous emails and would still like to participate as a PC member, please do reply to this email to indicate your participation. Also, if you would like to keep in touch or be removed from our mailing list please do reply to this email to indicate your contact preferences. 

If you know of any potential work that is relevant to the workshop, we hope that you can help to encourage submissions and/or participation to the workshop to your local community. We'll be sending out the first call for paper very soon!

Please do give us any feedback about the workshop if you have any.
