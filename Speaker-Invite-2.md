Dear Thomas,

We are excited to invite you as our guest speaker for the 2nd Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) in year 2020.

The PyTorch Transformer tool has been one of the most influential NLP OSS in the previous years. The initial idea of putting all BERT-like models in once place is so good, we wished we had also thought about that earlier! Your experience in putting together so many different models into a single library and how to design the library's interface in a generic way to accomodate the different nuances of the models would be very valuable to the workshop and provides a first-hand experience at creating and maintaining NLP Open Source Software.

We would like to invite you to give a talk on any aspect(s) of Open Source Software and PyTorch Transformer or any other NLP OSS that you would like to share about.

The NLP-OSS workshop is unlike the normal scientific track of academic workshop, our primary objective of this workshop is to further the sharing of insights on the engineering and community aspects of creating, developing and maintaining NLP open source software (OSS) which we seldom talk about in scientific publications. The secondary goal is to promote synergies between different open source projects and encourage cross-software comparisons. Our organizers and committee comprises of experts like yourself with notable OSS contribution to ML/NLP projects.

More details about the first edition of the workshop workshop can be found on https://nlposs.github.io/

Our proposal would be submitted to one of the four conferences and the workshop would be co-located with either:

| Conference	| Location | 	Time |
|:-|:-|:-|
| ACL	| Seattle, Washington | 9-10 July 2020|
| COLING	| Barcelona, Spain | 13-14 September 2020 |
| EMNLP	| Barceló Bávaro Convention <br> Centre, Dominican Republic  | 11-12 November 2020 |
| AACL/IJCNLP 2020 | Suzhou, China | 4-7 December 2020 |

We understand that confirming your participation across that many dates might be too overwhelming. But by end October, we will get the proposal confirmation from ACL and we can confirm the exact dates for our workshop (it just be one of four dates listed above). But we would need your agreement to be one of invited speakers before 22 September when submitting our proposal to the ACL committee.

We look forward to your response and hopefully seeing you speak at NLP-OSS 2020!

Thank you in advance for your response.

Best Regards,
NLP-OSS Organizers
