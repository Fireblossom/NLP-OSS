Dear Harrison,

We are excited to invite you as our guest speaker for the 3rd Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) in 2023, co-located with EMNLP at Singapore on 06 December.

We get to know about LangChain through using the ChatGPT through the Langchain API. LangChain has gain popularity and its connection OpenAPI and Huggingface has been a great tools for developers and many ACL/EMNLP researchers would like to learn more about the tools and convenience that LangChain provides. We would like to invite you to give a talk about how LangChain started and scaled to the state of how it is today with 2 millions downloads to date! Your experience with building the LangChain API will be very valuable to the workshop that could be shared with the ACL community at the NLP-OSS workshop.

The NLP-OSS workshop is unlike the normal scientific track of academic workshops, our primary objective of this workshop is to further the sharing of insights on the engineering and community aspects of creating, developing and maintaining NLP open source software (OSS) which we seldom talk about in scientific publications. The secondary goal is to promote synergies between different open source projects and encourage cross-software comparisons. Our organizers and committee comprises of experts like yourself with notable OSS contribution to ML/NLP projects. Previous editions of NLP-OSS workshop have hosted creators and maintainers of popular open source software, e.g. Huggingface Transformers, Marian NMT, Stanford CoreNLP, scikit-learn.

More details about the of the workshop can be found on https://nlposs.github.io/

We look forward to your response and hopefully seeing you speak at NLP-OSS 2023!

Thank you in advance for your response.

Best Regards, NLP-OSS Organizers
