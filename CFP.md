The First Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) will be co-located 
with ACL 2018 at Melbourne, Australia on 20 July 2018. 

Focusing more on the social and engineering aspect of NLP software 
and less on scientific novelty or state-of-art models, the Workshop for NLP-OSS 
is an academic forum to advance open source developments for NLP research, 
teaching and application.

NLP-OSS also provides an academic workshop to announce new software/features, 
promote the collaborative culture and best practices that go beyond the conferences.

We invite full papers (8 pages) or short papers (4 pages) on topics related to 
NLP-OSS broadly categorized into (i) software development, (ii) scientific 
contribution and (iii) NLP-OSS case studies.
