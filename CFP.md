The Workshop for NLP-OSS hopes to be the intellectual forum to collate engineering 
knowledge focusing more on the building aspect of NLP and less on scientific 
novelty or state-of-art development. 

NLP-OSS also provides an the academic workshop platforms to announce new software/features, 
promote the open source culture and best practices that go beyond the conferences.

We invite full papers (8 pages) or short papers (4 pages) on topics related to NLP-OSS 
broadly categorized into (i) software development, (ii) scientific contribution 
and (iii) NLP-OSS case studies.
