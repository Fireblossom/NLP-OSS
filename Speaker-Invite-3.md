Dear Thomas,

We are excited to re-invite you or anyone from HuggingFace as our guest speaker for the 3rd Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) in year 2023, colocated with EMNLP at Singapore in 06 December.

It has been a quite a journey since `pytorch-pretrained-bert` and your talk at our last workshop. We would like to invite you to give a talk on any aspect(s) of Open Source Software and the HuggingFace suite of libraries or any other topics on LLMs OSS that you would like to share about. Your experience with building HuggingFace to the scale today is very valuable to the workshop that could be shared with the ACL community at the NLP-OSS workshop.

The NLP-OSS workshop is unlike the normal scientific track of academic workshop, our primary objective of this workshop is to further the sharing of insights on the engineering and community aspects of creating, developing and maintaining NLP open source software (OSS) which we seldom talk about in scientific publications. The secondary goal is to promote synergies between different open source projects and encourage cross-software comparisons. Our organizers and committee comprises of experts like yourself with notable OSS contribution to ML/NLP projects. Previous editions of NLP-OSS workshop have hosted creators and maintainers of popular open source software, e.g. Huggingface Transformers, Marian NMT, Stanford CoreNLP, scikit-learn.

More details about the of the workshop can be found on https://nlposs.github.io/

We look forward to your response and hopefully seeing you speak at NLP-OSS 2023!

Thank you in advance for your response.

Best Regards, NLP-OSS Organizers
