# NLP-OSS

This is the Github page where we keep track of the developments of NLP-OSS workshop. 

The ACL/COLING/EMNLP/NAACL proposal is at https://github.com/alvations/NLP-OSS/blob/master/Proposal.md

Let's use the issue tracker to do the following:

 - confirm the people in the program committee
 - catch suggestions/comments and grammar errors in the proposal
