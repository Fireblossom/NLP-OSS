You see this shiny *GPT model, but it doesn't work on your data. You did some magic to the code and now it works. Show us how you did it!  Small tweaks, well-motivated and empirically tested are valid submissions to NLP-OSS

Managed to get hundreds, thousands or millions of user to your #nlproc open source tool? How did you design the code? Did users' feedback help you improve your library? Share your knowledge at NLP-OSS!

You have tried the latest LLM models, bore grievances but found the solution after hours of coffee. Share at NLP-OSS and suggest how open source could change for the better (e.g. best practices, documentation, API design)

You came across an awesome SOTA library on NLP task X that no LLM has beaten its F1 score. But now it takes a dinosaur to understand the stale code. Share your experience at NLP-OSS and propose how to "replicate" the library.
