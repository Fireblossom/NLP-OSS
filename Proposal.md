Workshop for Natural Language Processing Open Source Software (NLP-OSS)
====


With great scientific breakthrough comes solid engineering. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has benefited much from the open culture in sharing knowledge, data and software. The primary objective of this workshop is to further the sharing of insights on the engineering and community aspects of creating, developing and maintaining NLP open source software (OSS) which we seldom talk about in scientific publications. Our secondary goal is to promote synergies between different open source projects and encourage cross-software comparisons. 

We refer to Natural Language Processing OSS as an umbrella term that not only covers traditional syntactic, semantic, phonetic and pragmatic applications; we extend the definition to include 
task-specific applications (e.g. machine translation, information retrieval, question-answering systems), 
byte-level string processing that are contains valid linguistic information (e.g. unicode creation for new languages, language-based character set definitions) and 
machine learning / artificial intelligence frameworks with functionalities focusing on text applications

There are many workshops focusing open language resource/annotation creation and curation (e.g. BUCC, WAC, LOD, GWN, LAW). Moreover we have the flagship LREC conference dedicated to language resource. But the engineering aspects of the NLP OSS is overlooked and under-discussed within the community. To our best knowledge, this is first workshop proposal that focuses more on the building aspect of NLP and lesser so on scientific novelty or state-of-art development.

More often than not, NLP OSS developers/users interact in silos communities within the ecologies of their respective projects. In the earlier days of NLP, linguistic softwares were often monolithic and the learning curve to install, use and extend the tools were steep and frustrating. 

With the advent of cross programming-language support for NLP and high-level languages like Python, R, Ruby and Julia, we begin to see the synergies between cross-community support across NLP OSS. 

One classic example is NLTK’s support for Stanford NLP tools which provides a Pythonic interface to the Stanford tools written in Java. And more recently, the REST-ful API from Stanford CoreNLP tools has alleviated a host of issues that related to cross OSS interfaces in NLTK. The developers has also interacted across their respective code repositories to raise issues and give code reviews (c.f. https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pull/1249 ).  Beyond the diamond sharpening diamond effect of cross-OSS collaborations, the result of the successful interface between the tools opens door to easily benchmark annotations created by NLTK and Stanford CoreNLP.

Another example of precious OSS knowledge comes from SpaCy developer, where Montani (2017, https://ines.io/blog/spacy-commercial-open-source-nlp) shared her thoughts and challenges of commercial NLP OSS.  

We hope that our NLP-OSS workshop becomes the intellectual forum to collate these knowledges, announce new software/features, promotes the open source culture and best practices that goes beyond the conferences.

## Workshop Structure

To promote closer interaction, all accepted publications will present their work in the poster format and be required to give a 1 slide (90 seconds?) introduction of their work. For the rest of the workshop, invited talks will be given by maintainers of prominent NLP OSS and we plan to close the workshop with a panel session with the invited speakers and the audience of the workshop.
