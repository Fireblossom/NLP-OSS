Dear ____,

Thank you again for accepting the invitation to Workshop for NLP-OSS 2023 Program Committee! We will be co-located with EMNLP this year on the sunny island of Singapore.

We have sent you a request to fill out the pre-workshop survey but we haven't heard from you since our invitation. **Please kindly spare a few minutes to fill out this form https://forms.gle/MDKCoD1x44YXALb78 so that we get your name, contact and affiliations right.**

Thank you in advance for your time in filling up the survey and your support for the NLP-OSS workshop! 

We will be sending out social media and mailing list posts to announce the 2nd CFP in a couple of days. We hope you can help share with your peers, students, and contacts interested in NLP and OSS. We look forward to a fruitful workshop ahead!

With your help, I'm sure we can make NLP-OSS a success and grow the NLP OSS community together!

Best Regards, 
NLP-OSS Organizers
