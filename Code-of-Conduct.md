## ACL Anti-Harassment Policy

The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of the ACL. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated on-line discussions. This includes: speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person's participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it through ensuring that all are welcome to participate in shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.

It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any current member of the ACL Executive Committee or contact Priscilla Rasmussen (acl@aclweb.org), who is usually available at the registration desk during ACL conferences. Members of the executive committee will be instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.

## Why have a code of conduct?

(**Adaptations from the original ACL's anti-harassment policy is italicized in the following code of conduct**)

Same as the ACL anti-harassment policy, we hope to achieve the goal of *open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate at the NLP-OSS workshop. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, NLP-OSS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs. We want to reiterate our stance on zero-tolerance for bad actors, misconduct, non-inclusivity, harassement and discrimation with this code of conduct.* 

Our goals are to create the best avenue to discuss NLP and OSS related issues and promote synergies across different OSS projects. We want every member in the community (i.e. authors, attendees, supporters, programme committee members and organizers) to focus their full attention on scientific, engineering and community building aspects of NLP-OSS. And this is impossible to do if you are being harassed, stalked, or discriminated against.

Accordingly, all member in the community (i.e. publication authors, guest speakers, attendees, supporters, programme committee members and organizers), are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other in all interactions, whether at NLP-OSS workshop or in our online interactions, or in other contexts.

To make sure that everyone has a common understanding of “show respect and courtesy to each other,” we have extended ACL's anti-harassment policy and adopted the following code of conduct. The code of conduct is enforced by the NLP-OSS organizers and all misconduct or hostility will be reported to the ACL Executive Committee. 


## Appropriate behavior

We encourage and strive for the following types of behavior when communicating with fellow member in the NLP-OSS community.

### Be friendly and patient

 1. We are all volunteers organizing, supporting and/or attending the workshop. A sense of fun and passion is part of why we do what we do. Be positive and engaging, rather than snarky.
 2. During a talk, if someone asks a question, it's because clarification is needed by the person. Politely answer the question or hold the questions to the end of the talk. The questioner should also be patient if the speaker wants to postpone the questions to the end of the talk.

### Be civil and considerate

 1. Disagreement is no excuse for poor conduct or personal attacks. A community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive one.
 2. If you would not feel comfortable saying something to a co-worker or acquaintance, it is probably not appropriate on to any NLP-OSS member either.
 
### Assume good faith

 1. Remember that issues we want to discuss in NLP-OSS are often neglected in pubcliations, they may be complex and difficult to assess/answer. If you disagree (on a point/discussion), please do so politely, by disputing logical errors and factual premises rather than by attacking individuals.
 2. If something seems outrageous, check that you did not misinterpret it. Ask for clarification, rather than assuming the worst.
 

## Unacceptable behavior

The following types of behavior are unacceptable at NLP-OSS, both online and in-person, and constitute code of conduct violations.

### Abusive behavior

*Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at NLP-OSS or any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated on-line discussions.* 

 - **Hostility** - inlcuing *speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person's participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event*

 - **Harassment** —including *race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, body sizem or gender identity. As well as sexual images in public spaces, degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention.*

 - **Threats** —threatening someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone’s personal life.


### Unwelcoming behavior

 - **Blatant -isms** —saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. Subtle -isms and small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you broke a social rule, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered unwelcoming behavior, and is not allowed at NLP-OSS.
 
  -  **Maliciousness towards other NLP-OSS members in the community** deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling someone they’re not a real linguist/programmer or that they don’t belong at NLP-OSS or ACL.

 - **Being especially unpleasant** —for example, if we’ve received reports from multiple NLP-OSS members about annoying, rude, or especially distracting behavior.
 
 
While ACL and NLP-OSS are professional community, it's also a community of friends. We ask you to be aware of the fact that conversations (online/offline interactions) that may be appropriate within the context of a specific friendship or relationship with another NLP-OSS members may be inappropriate at the NLP-OSS workshop and other online comunication channels, also these conversations may be inappropriate in a group conversation with other NLP-OSS members you don't know well.


## Interpretation

This code of conduct is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. 

*The ACL's anti-harassment policy and NLP-OSS code of conduct are not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it through ensuring that all are welcome to participate in shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the ACL's anti-harassment policy.*

## Enforcement

*It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact NLP-OSS organizers, any current member of the ACL Executive Committee or contact Priscilla Rasmussen (acl@aclweb.org), who is usually available at the registration desk during ACL conferences. Members of the executive committee will be instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.*
